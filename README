Files associated with routing PKI project.

Required reading:

- RFC 3779
- Portions of RFCs 3280 and 3852
- draft-ietf-sidr-*
- draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-protocol

Programs:

- openssl: development copy of OpenSSL with RFC 3779 support added.
  Patches for this have been submitted to the OpenSSL project and were
  incorporated into release OpenSSL 0.9.8e.

  At present we're using an unmodified copy of the OpenSSL 1.0
  release, but the RFC 3779 code isn't enabled by default at compile
  time, so we need to build our own copy with the right configuration
  options.  So we ship a distribution tarball and a makefile that
  knows how to unpack, configure, and build it, so that other tools in
  this package can use the resulting libraries.

- rcynic: "cynical rsync" validator for rsync-based RPKI repositories.

- rpkid: rpkid and friends, a collection of Python programs to handle
  the publication side of the RPKI project.

- utils and scripts: various little test programs and utilities, not
  really intended for use by anyone but the author.  If they're
  useful, cool, enjoy, but if they blow up in your face, set your
  computer on fire, and turn your cat blue, that's your problem.

- rtr-origin: a Python implementation of the "RPKI/Router" protocol
  described in draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-protocol.

Other:

- presentations: miscellaneous presentations and design documents for
  the project.

Documentation:

- rcynic: See rcynic/README.

- rpkid:

  - See rpkid/doc/manual.tar.gz for a gzipped tarball of the entire
    manual in HTML format.

  - There's also a PDF version of the manual in rpkid/doc/manual.pdf.
    The documentation on the code internals is uglier than in the HTML
    version, but the installation and setup documenation should be
    readable.

  - There are also flat text versions of the most important parts of
    the installation and setup documentation, in the rpkid/doc
    directory.

  All of the rpkid documentation is produced by Doxygen from a single
  set of documentation sources.  The flat text files are html2text
  dumps of the HTML.

- Others: See READMEs and source code in the individual directories.

Files associated with routing PKI project.

Required reading:

- RFC 3779
- Portions of RFC 3280
- draft-ietf-sidr-res-certs

Programs:

- openssl: development copy of OpenSSL with RFC 3779 support added.
  Patches for this have been submitted to the OpenSSL project but have
  not yet been incorporated into the OpenSSL distribution.

- rcynic: "cynical rsync" validator for rsync-based RPKI repositories.

- tests and scripts: various little test programs and utilities, not
  really intended for use by anyone but the author.  If they're
  useful, cool, enjoy, but if they blow up in your face, set your
  computer on fire, and turn your cat blue, that's your problem.

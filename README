Files associated with routing PKI project.

Required reading:

- RFC 3779
- Portions of RFCs 3280 and 3852
- draft-ietf-sidr-*

Programs:

- openssl: development copy of OpenSSL with RFC 3779 support added.
  Patches for this have been submitted to the OpenSSL project and were
  incorporated into release OpenSSL 0.9.8e.

  At present we're using unmodified copies of OpenSSL project
  snapshots, because we need CMS code that's not yet in any released
  version.  So we keep a distribution tarball and a makefile that
  knows how to unpack, configure, and build it, so that other tools in
  this package can use the resulting libraries.

- rcynic: "cynical rsync" validator for rsync-based RPKI repositories.

- rpkid: rpkid and friends, a collection of Python programs to handle
  the publication side of the RPKI project.

- myrpki: a minimal (text-file-based) sample back-end setup (IRBE).
  No GUI, not suitable for anything complex, but perhaps sufficient
  for alpha testers.

- utils and scripts: various little test programs and utilities, not
  really intended for use by anyone but the author.  If they're
  useful, cool, enjoy, but if they blow up in your face, set your
  computer on fire, and turn your cat blue, that's your problem.

Other:

- presentations: miscellaneous presentations and design documents for
  the project.

- wiki-mirror: Mirror of selected documents from a Wiki at APNIC.

# Dragon Research Labs RPKI Toolkit

This is the "rpki.net" toolkit developed and maintained primarily by
Dragon Research Labs.  It's had several other names over the years
("DRL RPKI toolkit", "ISC RPKI toolkit", etc), but it's the same
toolkit under the same BSD-style license, now moved to GitHub.

## Documentation

You can find documentation salvaged from the old wiki in the doc/
subdirectory: see the README in that directory for details.

## Binary packages

Binary packages for Ubuntu Xenial and Debian Jessie are available from
https://download.rpki.net/APTng/.

The source packaging scripts for FreeBSD are a bit stale, someday
we'll fix that.

## Thanks

From 2006 through 2008, this work was funded by [ARIN](http://www.arin.net/).

From 2009 through 2016, this work was funded by [DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/).

Special thanks to Michael Elkins, who wrote the web GUI and generally
served as a second brain and second set of eyeballs on a long list of
thorny technical problems.

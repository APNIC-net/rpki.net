# RPKI Tools Manual

This collection of tools implements both the production (CA) and relying party
(RP) sides of an RPKI environment.

Source code for the entire project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dragonresearch/rpki.net).

## Download and Install

Full source code is available, as are binary packages for a few platforms.

See the [installation instructions](01.RPKI.Installation.md) for how
to download the code and install it once you've downloaded it.

## Relying Party Tools

If you operate routers and want to use RPKI data to help secure them, you
should look at the [relying party tools](05.RPKI.RP.md).

## CA Tools

If you control RPKI resources and need an engine let you request certificates,
issue ROAs, or issue certificates to other entities, you should look at the
[CA tools](11.RPKI.CA.md).

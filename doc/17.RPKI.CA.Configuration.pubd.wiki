= [pubd] section = #pubd

pubd's default configuration file is the system `rpki.conf` file.
Start pubd with "`-c filename`" to choose a different configuration
file. All options are in the "`[pubd]`" section. BPKI certificates and
keys may be either DER or PEM format.

== sql-database == #sql-database

MySQL database name for pubd.

{{{
#!ini
sql-database = ${myrpki::pubd_sql_database}
}}}

== sql-username == #sql-username

MySQL user name for pubd.

{{{
#!ini
sql-username = ${myrpki::pubd_sql_username}
}}}

== sql-password == #sql-password

MySQL password for pubd.

{{{
#!ini
sql-password = ${myrpki::pubd_sql_password}
}}}

== publication-base == #publication-base

Root of directory tree where pubd should write out published data. You
need to configure this, and the configuration should match up with the
directory where you point rsyncd. Neither pubd nor rsyncd much cares
-where- you tell them to put this stuff, the important thing is that
the rsync URIs in generated certificates match up with the published
objects so that relying parties can find and verify rpkid's published
outputs.

{{{
#!ini
publication-base = ${myrpki::publication_base_directory}
}}}

== server-host == #server-host

Host on which pubd should listen for HTTP service requests.

{{{
#!ini
server-host = ${myrpki::pubd_server_host}
}}}

== server-port == #server-port

Port on which pubd should listen for HTTP service requests.

{{{
#!ini
server-port = ${myrpki::pubd_server_port}
}}}

== bpki-ta == #bpki-ta

Where pubd should look for the BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI certificate
verification within pubd traces back to this trust anchor. Don't
change this unless you really know what you are doing.

{{{
#!ini
bpki-ta = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/ca.cer
}}}

== pubd-cert == #pubd-cert

Where pubd should look for its own BPKI EE certificate. Don't change
this unless you really know what you are doing.

{{{
#!ini
pubd-cert = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/pubd.cer
}}}

== pubd-key == #pubd-key

Where pubd should look for the private key corresponding to its own
BPKI EE certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what you
are doing.

{{{
#!ini
pubd-key = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/pubd.key
}}}

== irbe-cert == #irbe-cert

Where pubd should look for the back-end control client's BPKI EE
certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what you are
doing.

{{{
#!ini
irbe-cert = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/irbe.cer
}}}

= Upgrading from a Previous Version =

* See wiki:doc/RPKI/CA/UI/GUI/Upgrading/BeforeMigration for the special situation where you are upgrading from a release '''prior to database migration support being added'''.

This page describes the steps you must take if you upgrading from a previous version of the software that is already installed on the system.  If you are installing for the first time see [[wiki:doc/RPKI/CA/UI/GUI/Installing]].

Run the following commands at a shell prompt.  Note that you do not need run these as the ''root'' user, any user with permission to read `/etc/rpki.conf` is sufficient.

{{{#!sh
rpki-manage syncdb
rpki-manage migrate
}}}

Note that at the end of the `syncdb` output you will see the following message:
{{{
Not synced (use migrations):
 - rpki.gui.app
(use ./manage.py migrate to migrate these)
}}}

You should '''ignore the message about running ./manage.py''' since that script does not exist in our setup (we use `rpki-manage` instead`).

== Restart Apache ==

In order to cause Apache to reload the web portal software using the newly installed software, it must be restarted.  Execute the following command as ''root'' in a shell:

{{{#!sh
apachectl restart
}}}

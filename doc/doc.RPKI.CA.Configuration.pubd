pubd's default configuration file is the system rpki.conf file. Start pubd with
-c filename to choose a different configuration file. All options are in the
section [pubd]. BPKI certificates and keys may be either DER or PEM format.

sql-database::

     MySQL database name for pubd.

     Default: ${myrpki::pubd_sql_database}

sql-username::

     MySQL user name for pubd.

     Default: ${myrpki::pubd_sql_username}

sql-password::

     MySQL password for pubd.

     Default: ${myrpki::pubd_sql_password}

publication-base::

     Root of directory tree where pubd should write out published data.
     You need to configure this, and the configuration should match up
     with the directory where you point rsyncd. Neither pubd nor rsyncd
     much cares -where- you tell them to put this stuff, the important
     thing is that the rsync URIs in generated certificates match up with
     the published objects so that relying parties can find and verify
     rpkid's published outputs.

     Default: ${myrpki::publication_base_directory}

server-host::

     Host on which pubd should listen for HTTP service requests.

     Default: ${myrpki::pubd_server_host}

server-port::

     Port on which pubd should listen for HTTP service requests.

     Default: ${myrpki::pubd_server_port}

bpki-ta::

     Where pubd should look for the BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
     certificate verification within pubd traces back to this trust
     anchor. Don't change this unless you really know what you are doing.

     Default: ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/ca.cer

pubd-cert::

     Where pubd should look for its own BPKI EE certificate. Don't change
     this unless you really know what you are doing.

     Default: ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/pubd.cer

pubd-key::

     Where pubd should look for the private key corresponding to its own
     BPKI EE certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what
     you are doing.

     Default: ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/pubd.key

irbe-cert::

     Where pubd should look for the back-end control client's BPKI EE
     certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what you are
     doing.

     Default: ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/irbe.cer

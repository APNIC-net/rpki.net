= [rpkid] section = #rpkid

rpkid's default config file is the system `rpki.conf` file. Start
rpkid with "`-c filename`" to choose a different config file. All
options are in the "`[rpkid]`" section. BPKI Certificates and keys may
be in either DER or PEM format.

== sql-database == #sql-database

MySQL database name for rpkid.

{{{
#!ini
sql-database = ${myrpki::rpkid_sql_database}
}}}

== sql-username == #sql-username

MySQL user name for rpkid.

{{{
#!ini
sql-username = ${myrpki::rpkid_sql_username}
}}}

== sql-password == #sql-password

MySQL password for rpkid.

{{{
#!ini
sql-password = ${myrpki::rpkid_sql_password}
}}}

== server-host == #server-host

Host on which rpkid should listen for HTTP service requests.

{{{
#!ini
server-host = ${myrpki::rpkid_server_host}
}}}

== server-port == #server-port

Port on which rpkid should listen for HTTP service requests.

{{{
#!ini
server-port = ${myrpki::rpkid_server_port}
}}}

== irdb-url == #irdb-url

HTTP service URL rpkid should use to contact irdbd. If irdbd is
running on the same machine as rpkid, this can and probably should be
a loopback URL, since nobody but rpkid needs to talk to irdbd.

{{{
#!ini
irdb-url = http://${myrpki::irdbd_server_host}:${myrpki::irdbd_server_port}/
}}}

== bpki-ta == #bpki-ta

Where rpkid should look for the BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
certificate verification within rpkid traces back to this trust
anchor. Don't change this unless you really know what you are doing.

{{{
#!ini
bpki-ta = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/ca.cer
}}}

== rpkid-cert == #rpkid-cert

Where rpkid should look for its own BPKI EE certificate. Don't change
this unless you really know what you are doing.

{{{
#!ini
rpkid-cert = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/rpkid.cer
}}}

== rpkid-key == #rpkid-key

Where rpkid should look for the private key corresponding to its own
BPKI EE certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what you
are doing.

{{{
#!ini
rpkid-key = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/rpkid.key
}}}

== irdb-cert == #irdb-cert

Where rpkid should look for irdbd's BPKI EE certificate. Don't change
this unless you really know what you are doing.

{{{
#!ini
irdb-cert = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/irdbd.cer
}}}

== irbe-cert == #irbe-cert

Where rpkid should look for the back-end control client's BPKI EE
certificate. Don't change this unless you really know what you are
doing.

{{{
#!ini
irbe-cert = ${myrpki::bpki_servers_directory}/irbe.cer
}}}

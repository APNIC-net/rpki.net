= Installing the Web Portal for the First Time =

This page documents how to install the web portal software.  '''If you have previously installed the software''', see [[wiki:doc/RPKI/CA/UI/GUI/Upgrading]] for instructions.

== Prerequisites ==

This page assumes that you have already followed the steps to install the CA software (see [[wiki:doc/RPKI/Installation]])

This page assumes that you have already created `/etc/rpki.conf` (see [[wiki:doc/RPKI/CA/Configuration]])

== Create Database Tables ==

This step creates the tables used by the web portal in the database.  Run the following commands in the shell (you do not need to be ''root'', just have permission to read `/etc/rpki.conf`):

{{{#!sh
rpki-manage syncdb --noinput
rpki-manage migrate
}}}

Note that at the end of the `syncdb` output you will see the following message:
{{{
Not synced (use migrations):
 - rpki.gui.app
(use ./manage.py migrate to migrate these)
}}}

You should '''ignore the message about running ./manage.py''' since that script does not exist in our setup (we use `rpki-manage` instead`).

== Next Step ==

This directory contains documentation salvaged from https://wiki.rpki.net/.

The original source format is Trac wiki, but the Trac instance in
question is ailing, some of the plug-ins it uses are obsolete, and
Markdown is more commonly used for this sort of thing these days in
any case, so extracting this from the ailing Wiki seemed advisable.

The numbered files in this directory were extracted by a Python script
(included).  Several kinds of files are present:

* .wiki files, containing the raw Trac Wiki page text;

* .md files, resulting from feeding the HTML version of the Wiki pages
  into an automated HTML-to-Markdown translator;

* various graphics formats (.svg, .jpg) holding images which were
  used inline in some of the Wiki pages; and

* .zip files, containing attachments to the Wiki pages.

In some cases the attachments in the .zip files will be the same as
the image files, but not always.  What you see is what there was.

There are two main problems with this documentation at present:

1. It's for the old version of the RPKI code (branch old-trunk) rather
   than the current version (branch master).

2. The translation to Markdown almost certainly needs some help from a
   human being, what's here is just what html2markdown could do.

Nevertheless, the content recorded here was a fairly complete manual
at one point, and it would almost certainly be a lot easier to finish
the conversion and bring it up to date than to start over.

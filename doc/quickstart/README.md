# DRL QuickStart Instructions

These are quick start instructions for installing DRL CA and RP software
on various platforms.  At the moment, only Ubuntu Xenial is covered, but
Debian Jessie is substantially similar, other than the APT URLs.
More to come.

## Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 RPKI Relying Party Cache Install

Do NOT try this on Ubuntu 14.04 or other versions of Ubuntu.  We do
builds for 16.04 only.

Given a running Ubuntu 16.04 xenial server, installing Relying Party
software should take ten minutes.

Use [this set of instructions](xenial-rp.md)

## Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 RPKI Certificate Authority Install

Given a running Ubuntu 16.04 xenial server, installing a full CA
software set should take less than an hour.


== Presentation Archive ==

This is an archive of various presentations and supporting materials we've accumulated over the years.

OK, I lied.  This is really an archive of stuff that had accumulated in the /presentations directory of the subversion repository, which we decided really belonged here in the Wiki instead.   At some point we may get around to organizing this in a more useful fashion.

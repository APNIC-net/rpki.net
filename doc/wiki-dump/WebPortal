= Web Portal =

The RPKI Web Portal currently requires Django 1.2 or later.

Django upstream currently provides support for the previous two minor releases, which is 1.2 and 1.3 as of the writing of this page (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/internals/release-process/#supported-versions).

Targeting RHEL/CentOS/Scientific 6.x and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  Should work with any newer Fedora or Ubuntu release as well, but those are not typically deployed as production servers.


== Platforms ==

=== Ubuntu 10.04 ===

Ships with Django 1.1.1 which is out of upstream's support window.  My recommendation is to install or rebuild a newer supported release.

* Ubuntu Maverick (10.10) and Natty (11.04) do have 1.2.x releases, but seem to be missing the security patches from the 1.2.7 release (https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/security-releases-issued/).  
* The 1.3 release in Oneiric (11.10) also seems to be missing the security updates from that same advisory.

==== Installing Django 1.3.1 PPA ====

This section describes how to install a pre-built PPA package for python-django 1.3.1.

Put the following in your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:
{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/chris-lea/python-django/ubuntu lucid main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/chris-lea/python-django/ubuntu lucid main 
}}}

Then run the following commands:
{{{
# apt-get update
# apt-get install python-django
}}}

* [https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/python-django python-django PPAs]

==== Rebuilding python-django from source deb ====

The 1.3.1 package from Precise Pangolin (12.04 LTS) doesn't build due to build dependencies for newer python-sphinx than ships with 10.04 LTS.  However, once built you can install the new python-django package on other systems without needing to upgrade other packages.  You can also chose to build the 1.2.5 release from Natty (11.04).

To rebuild the python-django package:
{{{
# apt-get install dpkg-dev
# apt-get build-dep python-django
# tar zxvf python-django_1.2.5.orig.tar.gz
# cd Django-1.2.5
# tar zxvf ../python-django_1.2.5-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.gz
# dpkg-buildpackage
}}}

* https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django

=== RHEL/CentOS/Scientific 6 ===

Django is not included in base OS, but Django 1.2 is available via EPEL (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).

Once you have enabled the EPEL repository, you can run:
{{{
# yum install Django
}}}

==== SELinux ====

Extra steps are required to run the Web Portal with SELinux enabled.

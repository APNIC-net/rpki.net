= rpki.net project site =

This is the Trac site for the rpki.net project.  The project provides a free, BSD License, open source, complete system for the Internet Registry or ISP.  It includes separate components which may be combined to suit your needs:
* Certification Engine
* Relying Party Cache (sometimes called a 'validator')
* rpki-rtr protocol, to feed the data to routers doing RPKI-based origin validation
* GUI for use by users of the 'hosted' model (i.e. customers who do not run their own CA)
* Web Reporting Pages so you can see what your cache has found
* Creation of pseudo-IRR data for those who wish to feed RPSL toolchains

If you're looking for the general RPKI Wiki (not specific to our software), it's [[http://wiki.rpki.net/|over here]].

== Downloads ==

See [[/wiki/doc/RPKI|the documentation]] for how to download and install the code.

We now have [[http://download.rpki.net/APT/debian/|Debian packages]], [[http://download.rpki.net/APT/ubuntu/|Ubuntu packages]], and [[http://download.rpki.net/FreeBSD_Packages/|FreeBSD ports]] of the code.

You can also [[/browser|browse the source code]].

[[http://www.hactrn.net/opaque/rcynic/|Current status of RPKI system as seen by one relying party]].

== TLS Certificate ==

If you're trying to connect to this site (https://rpki.net/) using
HTTPS, you may see warnings about an untrusted certificate.  There's
nothing wrong, this just means that your web browser doesn't know
about the Certification Authority that we use.

You can [[http://www.hactrn.net/cacert.asc|download a PGP-signed version of the HACTRN CA certificate]] to fix this.

If you don't care about checking the CA certificate and just want the
warning to go away, you can set a browser exception or just
[[http://www.hactrn.net/cacert.cer|install the HACTRN CA certificate]]
without checking it.

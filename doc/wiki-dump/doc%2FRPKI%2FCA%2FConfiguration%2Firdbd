= [irdbd] section = #irdbd

irdbd's default configuration file is the system `rpki.conf` file.
Start irdbd with "`-c filename`" to choose a different configuration
file. All options are in the "`[irdbd]`" section.

Since irdbd is part of the back-end system, it has direct access to
the back-end's SQL database, and thus is able to pull its own BPKI
configuration directly from the database, and thus needs a bit less
configuration than the other daemons.

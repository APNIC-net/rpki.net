= [web_portal] section = #web_portal

Glue to allow the Django application to pull user configuration from
this file rather than directly editing settings.py.

== sql-database == #sql-database

SQL database name the web portal should use.

{{{
#!ini
sql-database = ${myrpki::irdbd_sql_database}
}}}

== sql-username == #sql-username

SQL user name the web portal should use.

{{{
#!ini
sql-username = ${myrpki::irdbd_sql_username}
}}}

== sql-password == #sql-password

SQL password the web portal should use.

{{{
#!ini
sql-password = ${myrpki::irdbd_sql_password}
}}}

== secret-key == #secret-key

Site-specific secret key for Django.

No default value.

== allowed-hosts == #allowed-hosts

Name of virtual host that runs the Django GUI, if this is not the same
as the system hostname. Django's security code wants to know the name
of the virtual host on which Django is running, and will fail when it
thinks it's running on a disallowed host.

If you get an error like "Invalid HTTP_HOST header (you may need to
set ALLOWED_HOSTS)", you will need to set this option.

No default value.

== download-directory == #download-directory

A directory large enough to hold the RouteViews.org routing table dump
fetched by the rpkigui-import-routes script.

{{{
#!ini
download-directory = /var/tmp
}}}

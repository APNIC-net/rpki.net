= RPKI Manual Table Of Contents =

[[TracNav(doc/RPKI/TOC)]]

**DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!!!**

**This is not a normal Wiki page, it's input to a Trac macro.**

**Read carefully before touching anything here.**

This page is the table of contents for the RPKI manual.  This uses the
!TracNav macro, to avoid replicating the list of pages everywhere;
instead, each page uses !TracNav to refer to this page, which contains
the one and only copy.  This list is also used to generate the PDF and
flat text documentation, via some ad hoc scripting and a preprosterous
set of text processing tools.

Be very careful when modifying this page.  In particular, be careful
about modifying the following list, as messing it up will break the
navigation for the entire manual.

Also note that syntax for links containing square brackets in the
label is very tricky and somewhat fragile.  We use this for TOC
entries corresponding to rpki.conf sections.  We can do this using
WikiCreole link syntax so long as we have whitespace before the double
close square bracket that ends the link.  Yes, this is a kludge.  See
http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/616 for details.

I (sra) just added the GUI subpages as they were missing entirely.
Titles might need work, and we don't yet know whether the HTML-to-text
hack will work on these as we haven't tried it yet.

The following is a non-list of nodes in the old (Doxygen) manual which
don't currently have any place in the new manual.  I haven't yet
figured out which of these we should keep, or where to put them.  So
long as they aren't formatted as part of the Wiki list, !TracNav will
ignore them.

Not sure where these should go yet.  Perhaps a RPKI/CA/Reference
section, except that sounds too much like a command reference.

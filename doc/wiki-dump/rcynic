= rcynic RPKI Validator =

`rcynic` is the name of the primary RPKI validation in the rpki.net
tool kit.

See the [[wiki:doc/RPKI/RP|overview of the rpki.net relying party tools]]
for an introduction to the tools that a router operator would use to
retrieve and validate data from the global RPKI system.

See [[wiki:doc/RPKI/Installation|the installation instructions]] for
details on how to download the code and run it yourself.

You can [[browser:trunk/rcynic|browse the rcynic source code]] if you like.

You can also [[wiki:doc/RPKI|read the full documentation for the toolkit]].

This page is a placeholder to provide a stable reference point for
external links to rcynic.  It's probably a bad idea for this page to
replicate too much of the information that's available elsewhere,
instead this page should provide links to current information.  If you
disagree and have edit rights in the Wiki, well, OK, fix this.

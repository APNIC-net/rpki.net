# rcynic RPKI Validator

`rcynic` is the name of the primary RPKI validation in the rpki.net tool kit.

See the [overview of the rpki.net relying party tools][1] for an introduction
to the tools that a router operator would use to retrieve and validate data
from the global RPKI system.

See [the installation instructions][2] for details on how to download the code
and run it yourself.

You can browse the rcynic source code if you like.

You can also [read the full documentation for the toolkit][3].

This page is a placeholder to provide a stable reference point for external
links to rcynic. It's probably a bad idea for this page to replicate too much
of the information that's available elsewhere, instead this page should
provide links to current information. If you disagree and have edit rights in
the Wiki, well, OK, fix this.

@section Protocol operations between IRBE and RPKI engine

The left-right protocol is really two separate client/server protocols
over separate channels.  The IRBE is the client for one of the
subprotocols, the RPKI engine is the client for the other.

@subsection Operations initiated by the IRBE

This part of the protcol uses a kind of message-passing.  Each object
that the RPKI engine knows about takes five messages: "create", "set",
"get", "list", and "destroy".  Actions which are not just data
operations on objects are handled via an SNMP-like mechanism, as if
they were fields to be set.  For example, to generate a keypair one
"sets" the "generate-keypair" field of a BSC object, even though there
is no such field in the object itself as stored in SQL.  This is a bit
of a kludge, but the reason for doing it as if these were variables
being set is to allow composite operations such as creating a BSC,
populating all of its data fields, and generating a keypair, all as a
single operation.  With this model, that's trivial, otherwise it's at
least two round trips.

Fields can be set in either "create" or "set" operations, the
difference just being whether the object already exists.  A "get"
operation returns all visible fields of the object.  A "list"
operation returns a list containing what "get" would have returned on
each of those objects.

Left-right protocol objects are encoded as signed CMS messages
containing XML as eContent and using an eContentType OID of id-ct-xml
(1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.28).  These CMS messages are in turn passed
as the data for HTTPS POST operations, with an HTTP content type of
"application/x-rpki" for both the POST data and the response data.

All operations allow an optional "tag" attribute which can be any
alphanumeric token.  The main purpose of the tag attribute is to allow 

@subsubsection <self/> object

A <self/> object represents one virtual RPKI engine.  In simple cases
where the RPKI engine operator operates the engine only on their own
behalf, there will only be one <self/> object, representing the engine
operator's organization, but in environments where the engine operator
hosts other entities, there will be one <self/> object per hosted
entity (probably including the engine operator's own organization,
considered as a hosted customer of itself).

Some of the RPKI engine's configured parameters and data are shared by
all hosted entities, but most are tied to a specific <self/> object.
Data which are shared by all hosted entities are referred to as
"per-engine" data, data which are specific to a particular <self/>
object are "per-self" data.

Since all other RPKI engine objects refer to a <self/> object via a
"self_id" value, one must create a <self/> object before one can
usefully configure any other left-right protocol objects.

Every <self/> object has a self_id attribute, which must be specified
for the "set", "get", and "destroy" actions.

Payload data which can be configured in a <self/> object:

@li use_hsm (attribute)

    Whether to use a Hardware Signing Module.  At present this option
    has no effect, as the implementation does not yet support HSMs.

@li crl_interval (attribute)

    Positive integer representing the planned lifetime of an RPKI CRL
    for this <self/>, measured in seconds.

@li regen_margin (attribute)

    Positive integer representing how long before expiration of an
    RPKI certificiate a new one should be generated, measured in
    seconds.  At present this only affects the one-off EE certificates
    associated with ROAs.

@li bpki_cert (subelement)

    BPKI CA certificate for this <self/>.  This is used as part of the
    certificate chain when validating incoming TLS and CMS messages,
    and should be the issuer of cross-certification BPKI certificates
    used in <repository/>, <parent/>, and <child/> objects.  If the
    bpki_glue certificate is in use (below), the bpki_cert certificate
    should be issued by the bpki_glue certificate; otherwise, the
    bpki_cert certificate should be issued by the per-engine bpki_ta
    certificate.

@li bpki_glue (subelement)

    Another BPKI CA certificate for this <self/>, usually not needed.
    Certain pathological cross-certification cases require a
    two-certificate chain due to issuer name conflicts.  If used, the
    bpki_glue certificate should be the issuer of the bpki_cert
    certificate and should be issued by the per-engine bpki_ta
    certificate; if not needed, the bpki_glue certificate should be
    left unset.

Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:

@li rekey

    Start a key rollover for every RPKI CA associated with every
    <parent/> object associated with this <self/> object.  This is the
    first phase of a key rollover operation.

@li revoke

    Revoke any remaining certificates for any expired key associated
    with any RPKI CA for any <parent/> object associated with this
    <self/> object.   This is the second (cleanup) phase for a key
    rollover operation; it's separate from the first phase to leave
    time for new RPKI certificates to propegate and be installed.

@li reissue

    Not implemented, may be removed from protocol.  Original theory
    was that this operation would force reissuance of any object with
    a changed key, but as that happens automatically as part of the
    key rollover mechanism this operation seems unnecessary.

@li run_now

    Force immediate processing for all tasks associated with this
    <self/> object that would ordinarily be performed under cron.  Not
    currently implemented.

@li publish_world_now

    Force (re)publication of every publishable object for this <self/>
    object.  Not currently implemented.   Intended to aid in recovery
    if RPKI engine and publication engine somehow get out of sync.


@subsubsection <bsc/> object

The <bsc/> ("business signing context") object represents all the BPKI
data needed to sign outgoing CMS or HTTPS messages.  Various other
objects include pointers to a <bsc/> object.  Whether a particular
<self/> uses only one <bsc/> or multiple is a configuration decision
based on external requirements: the RPKI engine code doesn't care, it
just cares that, for any object representing a relationship for which
it must sign messages, there be a <bsc/> object that it can use to
produce that signature.

Every <bsc/> object has a bsc_id, which must be specified for the
"get", "set", and "destroy" actions.  Every <bsc/> also has a self_id
attribute which indicates the <self/> object with which this <bsc/>
object is associated.

Payload data which can be configured in a <isc/> object:

@li signing_cert (subelement)

    BPKI certificate to use when generating a signature.

@li signing_cert_crl (subelement)

    CRL which would list signing_cert if it had been revoked.

Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:

@li generate_keypair

    Generate a new BPKI keypair and return a PKCS #10 certificate
    request.  The resulting certificate, once issued, should be
    configured as this <bsc/> object's signing_cert.

Additional attributes which may be specified when specifying
"generate_keypair":

@li key_type

    Type of BPKI keypair to generate.  "rsa" is both the default and,
    at the moment, the only allowed value.

@li hash_alg

    Cryptographic hash algorithm to use with this keypair.  "sha256"
    is both the default and, at the moment, the only allowed value.

@li key_length

    Length in bits of the keypair to be generated.  "2048" is both the
    default and, at the moment, the only allowed value.

Replies to "create" and "set" actions that specify "generate-keypair"
include a <bsc_pkcs10/> subelement, as do replies to "get" and "list"
actions for a <bsc/> object for which a "generate-keypair" command has
been issued.  The RPKI engine stores the PKCS #10 request, which
allows the IRBE to reuse the request if and when it needs to reissue
the corresponding BPKI signing certificate.

@subsubsection <parent/> object

The <parent/> object represents the RPKI engine's view of a particular
parent of the current <self/> object in the up-down protocol.  Due to
the way that the resource hierarchy works, a given <self/> may obtain
resources from multiple parents, but it will always have at least one;
in the case of IANA or an RIR, the parent RPKI engine may be a trivial
stub.

Every <parent/> object has a parent_id, which must be specified for
the "get", "set", and "destroy" actions.  Every <parent/> also has a
self_id attribute which indicates the <self/> object with which this
<bsc/> object is associated, a bsc_id attribute indicating the <bsc/>
object to be used when signing messages sent to this parent, and a
repository_id indicating the <repository/> object to be used when
publishing issued by the certificate issued by this parent.

Payload data which can be configured in a <parent/> object:

@li sia_base (attribute)

    The leading portion of an rsync URI that the RPKI engine should
    use when composing the publication URI for objects issued by the
    RPKI certificate issued by this parent.

@li sender_name (attribute)

    Sender name to use in the up-down protocol when talking to this
    parent.  The RPKI engine doesn't really care what this value is,
    but other implementations of the up-down protocol do care.

@li recipient_name (attribute)

    Recipient name to use in the up-down protocol when talking to this
    parent.   The RPKI engine doesn't really care what this value is,
    but other implementations of the up-down protocol do care.

@li bpki_cms_cert (subelement)

    BPKI CMS CA certificate for this <parent/>.  This is used as part
    of the certificate chain when validating incoming CMS messages If
    the bpki_cms_glue certificate is in use (below), the bpki_cms_cert
    certificate should be issued by the bpki_cms_glue certificate;
    otherwise, the bpki_cms_cert certificate should be issued by the
    bpki_cert certificate in the <self/> object.

@li bpki_cms_glue (subelement)

    Another BPKI CMS CA certificate for this <parent/>, usually not
    needed.  Certain pathological cross-certification cases require a
    two-certificate chain due to issuer name conflicts.  If used, the
    bpki_cms_glue certificate should be the issuer of the
    bpki_cms_cert certificate and should be issued by the bpki_cert
    certificate in the <self/> object; if not needed, the
    bpki_cms_glue certificate should be left unset.

@li bpki_https_cert (subelement)

    BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this <parent/>.  This is like the
    bpki_cms_cert object, only used for validating incoming TLS
    messages rather than CMS.

@li bpki_cms_glue (subelement)

    Another BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this <parent/>, usually not
    needed.  This is like the bpki_cms_glue certificate, only used for
    validating incoming TLS messages rather than CMS.

Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:

@li rekey

    This is like the rekey command in the <self/> object, but limited
    to RPKI CAs under this parent.

@li reissue

    This is like the reissue command in the <self/> object, but limited
    to RPKI CAs under this parent.

@li revoke

    This is like the revoke command in the <self/> object, but limited
    to RPKI CAs under this parent.

@subsubsection <child/> object

The <child/> object represents the RPKI engine's view of particular
child of the current <self/> in the up-down protocol.

Every <child/> object has a parent_id, which must be specified for
the "get", "set", and "destroy" actions.  Every <child/> also has a
self_id attribute which indicates the <self/> object with which this
<bsc/> object is associated.

Payload data which can be configured in a <child/> object:

@li bpki_cert (subelement)

    BPKI CA certificate for this <child/>.  This is used as part of
    the certificate chain when validating incoming TLS and CMS
    messages.  If the bpki_glue certificate is in use (below), the
    bpki_cert certificate should be issued by the bpki_glue
    certificate; otherwise, the bpki_cert certificate should be issued
    by the bpki_cert certificate in the <self/> object.

@li bpki_glue (subelement)

    Another BPKI CA certificate for this <child/>, usually not needed.
    Certain pathological cross-certification cases require a
    two-certificate chain due to issuer name conflicts.  If used, the
    bpki_glue certificate should be the issuer of the bpki_cert
    certificate and should be issued by the bpki_cert certificate in
    the <self/> object; if not needed, the bpki_glue certificate
    should be left unset.

Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:

@li reissue

    Not implemented, may be removed from protocol.

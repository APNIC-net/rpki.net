;;; Signed manifests for RPKI repositories.  We're using object (as
;;; opposed to channel) security for everything in the repository,
;;; which is the right thing to do for various reasons but leaves us
;;; open to attacks which intercept the rsync connection and drop
;;; valid objects out of an SIA collection.  At present this is not
;;; detectable, so we need a mechanism.
;;;
;;; Manifests as described here are modeled on CRLs, because the
;;; issues involved in detecting stale manifests, manifest replays,
;;; etc are similar to those for CRLs.  So we want many of the fields
;;; that a CRL has.  Syntax will probably differ, though, since RPKI
;;; repositories can contain objects not covered by CRLs (eg, ROAs),
;;; and we may well decide just to sign the manifest with CMS.
;;;
;;; See RFC 3280 section 5 for CRL layout and extensions.
;;;
;;; We're only trying to cover objects in the same SIA collection
;;; (directory) as the manifest.  We will probably want to name the
;;; manifest itself with a name derived from the g(ski) of the cert of
;;; which this is the SIA collection.  We'll need an EE cert to sign
;;; the manifest; the EE cert should probably just use RFC 3779
;;; inheritance to cover all the resources that its issuer holds.  If we
;;; use CMS, we might just want to include the EE cert in the CMS
;;; bag of certs.
;;;
;;; For the moment I assume we're signing with CMS, so the signature
;;; parameters and signature itself are not included below.

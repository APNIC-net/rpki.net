#
# Config file for myrpki.py, myirbe.py, and RPKI daemons when used
# with myrpki.py etc.  Notes:
#
# - There's some duplication of settings between some of the sections,
#   because each of the several daemons and control programs was
#   written as a free-standing program.  Lumping all of the config for
#   all of them into a single config file is just a convenience for
#   simple configurations; in complex cases you might not have any two
#   of them running on the same machine.
#
# - This config file is also read by the OpenSSL command line tool
#   running under mypki.py, so syntax must remain compatable with both
#   OpenSSL and Python config file parsers, and there's a big chunk of
#   OpenSSL voodoo towards the end of this file.

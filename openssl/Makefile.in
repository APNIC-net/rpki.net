# Kludge alert:
#
# The --prefix= and LIBRPATH= settings below are to force OpenSSL's
# baroque configuration mechanism to build shared libraries that will
# run out of the build tree.  This is temporary.  Once we write "make
# install" code, we'll have to change that to point to the directory
# where the OpenSSL shared libraries will be installed.

# We need to build with enable-shared whether we're really trying to
# build shared OpenSSL libraries or not, because _POW.so requires
# position independent code, so we need OpenSSL compiled with the
# options it would use for a shared library.

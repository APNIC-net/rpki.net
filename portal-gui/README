Portal GUI (web interface), written using the rpki Python libraries
and the Django web development framework.

This is still in early development, real installation directions
haven't been written yet, but there's a lot of general information
about Django at http://www.djangoproject.com/

This package is an interface to rpkid and friends, so it assumes that
you'll be running rpkid.  If you haven't already done so, you should
set up rpkid first; see ../rpkid/doc/Installation.

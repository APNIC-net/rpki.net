This is a hacked version of the Python OpenSSL Wrappers (POW) package.
At some point I'll package up the changes and send them to the package
maintainer (if I can find him), but I want my changes under version
control while I'm hacking.

POW is a nice package, although it appears not to have gotten much
attention recently.  It's really two separate packages, one of which
uses a few facilities from the other:

- POW itself is a Python extension module linked against OpenSSL.
  This (or some equivilent package like M2Crypto) is necessary if one
  wants to use the various crypto algorithms.

- POW.pkix is a pure-Python module that builds on the base POW module
  to support X509v3 extensions.  This, to me, is the most interesting
  thing about POW: it's the only X.509 package for Python I've seen
  that has a reasonably complete mapping of X.509v3 into native Python
  datatypes (M2Crypto, by comparision, only supports the text
  representations provided by the extension drivers in the OpenSSL
  libraries -- POW supports those too, but they're not as useful).

These are SAMPLE trust anchors for testing rcynic.  Any resemblance
between these files and real trust anchors living, dead, or wandering
the night in ghostly torment is purely coincidental.

Remember: it's only a trust anchor if a replying party says it is.
You're the relying party, so it's your call.

Some of these sample trust anchors are also available at

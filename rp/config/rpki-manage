# Using a Python script to run sudo to run a Python script is a bit
# silly, but it lets us use rpki.autoconf to locate sudo, lets us
# avoid needing a custom setuid wrapper, lets us avoid another pass
# through the adventures of shell quoting and tokenization, and
# generally is just a lot simpler to implement correctly.
#
# OK, it's probably a few milliseconds slower.  Big deal.

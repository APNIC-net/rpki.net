Installation

   Preliminary installation instructions for rpkid et al.

   These are the production-side RPKI tools, for Internet Registries
   (RIRs, LIRs, etc). See ../rcynic/README for relying party tools.

   rpkid is a set of Python modules supporting generation and maintenance
   of resource certificates. Most of the code is in the rpkid/rpki/
   directory. rpkid itself is a relatively small program that calls the
   library modules. There are several other programs that make use of the
   same libraries, as well as a collection of test programs.

   At present the package is intended to be run out of its build
   directory. Setting up proper installation in a system area using the
   Python distutils package would likely not be very hard but has not yet
   been done.

   Note that initial development of this code has been on FreeBSD, so
   installation will probably be easiest on FreeBSD.

   The first step to running the code is to build the OpenSSL and POW
   binaries. At present the OpenSSL code is just a copy of the stock
   OpenSSL 0.9.8g release, compiled with special options to enable RFC
   3779 support that ISC wrote under previous contract to ARIN. The POW
   (Python OpenSSL Wrapper) library is an extended copy of the stock POW
   release.

   To build these, cd to the top-level directory in the distribution and
   type "make".

   $ cd $top
   $ make

   This should automatically build everything, in the right order,
   including staticly linking the POW extension module with the OpenSSL
   library to provide RFC 3779 support.

   Next, see the list of required Python modules in rpkid/README. Note
   that the Python code requires Python version 2.5. Install any modules
   that might be missing.

   You will also need a MySQL installation. This code was developed using
   MySQL 5.1 and has been tested with MySQL 5.0 and 5.1.

   The architecture is intended to support hardware signing modules
   (HSMs), but the code to support them has not been written.

   At this point, you should have all the necessary software installed.
   You will probably want to test it. All tests should be run from the
   rpkid/ directory.

   Some of the tests require MySQL databases to store their data. To set
   up all the databases that the tests will need, run the SQL commands in
   rpkid/testbed.sql. The MySQL command line client is usually the easiest
   way to do this, eg:

   $ cd $top/rpkid
   $ mysql -u root -p <testbed.sql

   To run the tests, run "make all-tests":

   $ cd $top/rpkid
   $ make all-tests

   If nothing explodes, your installation is probably ok. Any Python
   backtraces in the output indicate a problem.

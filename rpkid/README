TO DO:

      * Rework handling of surprising responses to up-down requests.
        Right now we get confused when we find that parent has issued
        a cert that we don't remember requesting, even when we have
        the ca_detail object in question sitting in our SQL as
        pending.  This can happen if we throw an exception later and
        don't clean up properly -- which should never happen, but
        let's try to be robust about this.

	So we need to be smarter about comparing our own state with
	what we get back from our parent and figuring out what to do
	next.  We probably also need to commit changes to SQL earlier.

	In general we should never have more than one ca_detail in
	state pending for a given ca, but the current code blindly
	assumes that will never happen and never recovers if that
	assumption has been violated.

	STATUS: Not started.  Well, not as such.

	I've done some work in this part of the code and it's possible
	that the problem described above no longer applies...but I'd
	have to stare at the code for a while to know for sure.

      * Use a ticket system instead of trying to track work items in
        this README file and archived messages from the testbed list?

	STATUS: I have a trac instance, Randy has an RT instance, just
	need to decide whether to do something about this, pick one,
	and move on.

      * Error handling: make sure that exceptions map correctly to up-down error
	codes, flesh out left-right error codes. Note that the same exception may
	produce different error codes depending on which up-down PDU we're
	processing (sigh).

	Will require code audit for coherency, which is most of the work.

	TIME REQUIRED: Two weeks

	DEPENDS ON: almost everything else, as almost any code change
	can raise new exceptions that we'd need to handle.

	STATUS: Not started

      * db.commit(), db.rollback(), code audit for data integrity issues, fix any
	data integrity issues that turn up. Among other issues, need to handle loss
	of connection to database server and other MySQL errors. Need to be careful
	about recovery action depending on whether we had uncommitted changes.

	TIME REQUIRED (commit and rollback): 3-4 weeks

	TIME REQUIRED (data integrity audit): 1 week

	TIME REQUIRED (fix data integrity): Unknown, depends on code
	audit and results of runtime testing.

	DEPENDS ON: async tasking model rollback.

	STATUS: Not started

      * Resource subsetting (req_* attributes in up-down protocol), full
	implementation.	 Requires expanding SQL child_cert table to hold subset
	masks and rewriting a fair amount of code.

	TIME REQUIRED: 3-4 weeks

	STATUS: Not started

      * Performance testing.  Some very preliminary tests show a
	hotspot in the TLS code, but further testing will be needed,
	particularly after the async tasking model change.

	STATUS: Barely started

      * Clean up rootd.py to be usable in a production system.	Most
	urgent issues are handling of private keys, publishing outputs
	in pubd, and reissuing when details or keys change. May not
	need much else, as this is not a high-traffic server.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week

	STATUS: Not started

      * Update internals docs (Doxygen). Mostly this means updating
	function comments in the Python code, as the rest is
	automatic.  May require a bit more overview text to explain
	the workings and usage of the code.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week.

	STATUS: Ongoing

      * Add HSM support. Architecture includes it, current code does
	not.  First step here would be talking to somebody with strong
	understanding of PKCS# 11.

	TIME REQUIRED: Unknown

	STATUS: Not started

      * Tighten up syntax checking in left-right schema.

	TIME REQUIRED: One day.

	STATUS: Not started

      * rcynic handling of RPKI trust anchors does not yet support
        draft-ietf-sidr-ta.  Not needed for technical reasons
        ("trust-anchor-uri-with-key" method is roughly equivilent and
        much simpler), may be required for political reasons.

	TIME REQUIRED: Three days

	STATUS: Not started

      * Publication protocol ACL checking may need revisiting.	Tricky
	bit is making sure that repository receives enough information
	to know whether parent has authorized child to use parent's
	namespace in nesting case; in theory this is straightforward
	but requires careful checking.	Current implementation just
	uses a configured path check and does not attempt to trace
	back to permission from parent in nested publication case.
	Class and method design is intended to make it easy to drop in
	additional checks if needed.

	STATUS: Trivial version (required path check) done.

      * Investigate using EKU (RFC 3280 4.2.1.13) as an alternative to
	wiring in BPKI EE certs for left-right protocol.

	STATUS: Not started

      * Testing of this by anybody but the author and a few friends is
	going to require some kind of user interface.  Python based
	web UI is probably the most cost effective approach, Django
	might be a good base for this.	Some of the operations
	suggested in an initial brainstorming session on this are
	outside the scope of what rpkid currently knows how to do (eg,
	signing S/MIME "please route" messages), so one of the tasks
	here is to see if trying to write a user interface sheds light
	on required features that are currently missing.

	STATUS: CSV file based UI done and documented, perhaps usable.

		Django web UI for hosted case under development by a
		friendly Django wizard, current design has it just
		doing UI and I/O with its own SQL data, so will need a
		tool to sit between Django's SQL and our code.

      * At present there is no mechanism by which an IRBE could
	request signing of objects other than ROAs.  Eg, there has
	been some discussion of signing S/MIME letters to humans
	asking for routing, as an alternative to ROAs.	If we decide
	to support this at all, it turns into a generalization of the
	ROA problem, and suggests that perhaps ROA generation should
	be handled somewhere outside of rpkid and only passed to rpkid
	for signing.  This would be a significant change to the
	architecture, as it would remove rpkid's responsibility for
	keeping ROAs up to date.

	On further analysis: ROAs are different from S/MIME letters,
	in that ROAs are something we want both published and
	maintained on an ongoing basis until canceled, while S/MIME
	letters are one-offs that probably are not published.  So ROAs
	need -something- to keep them current, and that something
	might as well be rpkid unless we find a strong argument that
	it should be something else.

	STATUS: Not started

      * There has been some discussion both in and out of the SIDR WG
        on perhaps dropping TLS out of the up-down protocol, as it is
        arguably not providing much that we can't do equally well with
        CMS.  Left-right and publication are currently not SIDR WG
        docs, but presumably they would follow.  Dunno where this is
        going to go, but assuming for purposes of discussion that we
        do drop TLS, we'll want to rip all that code out.  This
        includes revising BPKI, SQL, left-right and publication
        protocols, and code using all of these both in daemons and UI
        tools.

	TIME REQUIRED: Three weeks (very rough guess).

	DEPENDS ON: Decision whether to keep or drop TLS.

	STATUS: Not started

      * Integrate UI tools into main code base.  Right now there's
        this odd split, with the myrpki stuff off to one side, irdbd
        (which is also a sample implementation, not a core tool) in
        with rpkid, test code scattered hither and yon in all the
        above places, and none of it set up nicely either for running
        in place or installation.  This all needs to be cleaned up,
        most likely by reorganizing all of the Python (and POW) code.

	TIME REQUIRED: Two weeks.

	STATUS: Not started

      * Autoconf review.  Right now we're making minimal use of
        autoconf, just enough to get the code running on Mac OS and
        clean up a few old annoyances.  There are other things that
        ought to be using autoconf, now that we're stuck with it.  Eg,
        installation scripts, the build code for POW, etc.  In the
        long run we might even want to check for usable system OpenSSL
        code and libraries: the RFC 3779 code is still off by default
        in all known public releases of OpenSSL, but the BPKI stuff
        that myrpki does only requires CMS, not RFC 3779, so it may be
        able to use the system openssl binary in many cases.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week for an initial pass.

	DEPENDS ON: Installation scripts.  Not so much depends on,
	really, as two aspects of one interrelated mess.

	STATUS: Not started

      * We need installation scripts.  Right now the only thing we
        install is rcynic, and that only on FreeBSD.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week, longer if installation for many platforms is
	required

	STATUS: Not started

      * We need better and unified documentation.  Right now doc is
        scattered between rpkid core manual, various READMEs, internal
        docuemntation in various tools, etcetera.  This is not kind to
        the user.  Depending on how much hand-written (as opposed to
        Doxygen-harvested) doc we end up with, might want to convert
        overall to something like the Doxygen/Docbook combination that
        the Boost project uses (Boostbook).

	TIME REQUIRED: At least two weeks, plus at least one more week
	if making a serious change in doc tools (eg, Boostbook).

	DEPENDS ON: Portions of this would make sense to defer until
	after whatever code reorg happens to integrate UI tools, etc.
	Most of the hand-written content could be done right away,
	might require minor edits later to track reorg changes.

	STATUS: Not started

      * Rewrite irbe_cli.py to use cmd module.   Right now irbe_cli is
        useful only as a debugging tool for its author, and the
        interface is very clunky (even by comparision to other clunky
        bits of code in this package).  Rewriting to use cmd module
        would be a major improvement; some minor challenges here
        because irbe_cli integrates so tightly with the Python message
        classes representing the left-right and publication protcols;
        figuring out how to turn this into a cmd-based program without
        massive (and fragile) duplication of code is probably good for
        a few days of head scratching.

	TIME REQUIRED: Two weeks (including head scratching)

	STATUS: Not started

      * Clean up testbed tools.  There's a collection of hacks that
        have been evolving as we've been building the testbed, most of
        which just grew as our needs evolved.  The main scripts are
        checked into the repository, but some of the minor stuff is
        not, and some of the automation used in the testbed (cron
        scripts, automated use of a version control system (currently
        subversion) to archive changes to running data, etcetera)
        might be useful to others, so it should be cleaned up and made
        available as part of the package.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week

	STATUS: Moving target, but let's say "not started" for the
	bits I'm thinking about as I type this.

      * Early (pseudo) operational testing has uncovered a conflict
        between RIRs need not to be in the business of attesting to
        identities and operators need to have -some- way of finding
        out who to call when a RPKI cert is broken.  Current proposal
        is to allow signature and publication of blobs of whois-like
        data; these would be signed by an EE cert using RFC 3779
        inheritance, and would in essence be a self-attestation (no
        checking by others, no liability incurred by others, etc) as
        to contact information one might use in case of a problem.
        This would require a minor change to the rescert profile, so
        the SIDR WG would need to sign off on this.  As this data
        would be published, presumably we would want rcynic to be able
        to check it.

	TIME REQUIRED: One week to add to rpkid et al (very rough --
	includes design work to figure out exactly where this would
	fit, actual coding probably relatively minor).  Perhaps an
	additional day or three to add to rcynic and write suitable
	search and display tools.

	DEPENDS ON: Agreement to add this to rescert profile.

	STATUS: Not started

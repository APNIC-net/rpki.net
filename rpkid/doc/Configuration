Configuration Guide

   This section describes the configuration file syntax and settings.

   Each of the programs that make up the RPKI tookit can potentially take
   its own configuration file, but for most uses this is unnecessarily
   complicated. The recommended approach is to use a single configuration
   file, and to put all of the parameters that a normal user might need to
   change into a single section of that configuration file, then reference
   these common settings from the program-specific sections of the
   configuration file via macro expansion. The configuration file parser
   supports a limited version of the macro facility used in OpenSSL's
   configuration parser. An expression such as

foo = ${bar::baz}

   sets foo to the value of the baz variable from section bar. The section
   name ENV is special: it refers to environment variables.

   The default name for the shared configuration file is myrpki.conf.

[myrpki]

   The [myrpki] section of myrpki.conf contains all the parameters that
   you really need to configure.

# Handle naming hosted resource-holding entity (<self/>) represented
# by this myrpki instance.  Syntax is an identifier (ASCII letters,
# digits, hyphen, underscore -- no whitespace, non-ASCII characters,
# or other punctuation).  You need to set this.

handle                          = Me

   Every resource-holding or server-operating entity needs a "handle",
   which is just an identifier by which the entity calls itself. Handles
   do not need to be globally unique, but should be chosen with an eye
   towards debugging operational problems: it's best if you use a handle
   that your parents and children will recognize as being you.

   Warning:
          The rest of this section of the configuration file isn't
          documented yet, beyond the comments already present in the
          example file.

# Names of various files and directories.  Don't change these without
# a good reason.

# DNS hostname and server port numbers for rpkid and irdbd, if you're

# If you want different usernames and passwords for the separate SQL
# databases, enter those settings here; the shared_sql_* settings are

# setting everything in this block.

# Name of OpenSSL binary.  You might need to change this if you have
# no system copy installed, or if the system copy doesn't support CMS.
# The copy of openssl built by this package should suffice.

# End of [myrpki] section

   Once you've finished with configuration, the next thing you should read
   is the Operation Guide.

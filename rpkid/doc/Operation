Operation Guide

   Preliminary operation instructions for rpkid et al.

   These are the production-side RPKI tools, for Internet Registries
   (RIRs, LIRs, etc). See rcynic/README for relying party tools.

   Warning:
          rpkid is still in development, and the code changes more often
          than the hand-maintained portions of this documentation. The
          following text was reasonably accurate at the time it was
          written but may be obsolete by the time you read it.

   At present the package is intended to be run out of the rpkid/
   directory.

   In addition to the library routines in the rpkid/rpki/ directory, the
   package includes the following programs:

     * rpkid.py: The main RPKI engine daemon.

     * pubd.py: The publication engine daemon.

     * rootd.py: A separate daemon for handling the root of an RPKI
       certificate tree. This is essentially a stripped down version of
       rpkid with no SQL database, no left-right protocol implementation,
       and only the parent side of the up-down protocol. It's separate
       because the root is a special case in several ways and it was
       simpler to keep the special cases out of the main daemon.

     * irdbd.py: A sample implementation of an IR database daemon. rpkid
       calls into this to perform lookups via the left-right protocol.

     * irbe_cli.py: A command-line client for the left-right control
       protocol.

     * cross_certify.py: A BPKI cross-certification tool.

     * irbe-setup.py: An example of a script to set up the mappings
       between the IRDB and rpkid's own database, using the left-right
       control protocol.

     * cronjob.py: A trivial HTTP client used to drive rpkid cron events.

     * testbed.py: A test tool for running a collection of rpkid and irdb
       instances under common control, driven by a unified test script.

     * testpoke.py: A simple client for the up-down protocol, mostly
       compatable with APNIC's rpki_poke.pl tool.

   Most of these programs take configuration files in a common format
   similar to that used by the OpenSSL command line tool. The test
   programs also take input in YAML format to drive the tests. Runs of the
   testbed.py test tool will generate a fairly complete set configuration
   files which may be useful as examples.

   Basic operation consists of creating the appropriate MySQL databases,
   starting rpkid, pubd, rootd, and irdbd, using the left-right control
   protocol to set up rpkid's internal state, and setting up a cron job to
   invoke rpkid's cron action at regular intervals. All other operations
   should occur either as a result of cron events or as a result of
   incoming left-right and up-down protocol requests.

   Note that the full event-driven model for rpkid hasn't yet been
   implemented. The design is intended to allow an arbitrary number of
   hosted RPKI engines to run in a single rpkid instance, but without the
   event-driven tasking model one must set up a separate rpkid instance
   for each hosted RPKI engine.

   At present the daemon programs all run in foreground, that is, if one
   wants them to run in background one must do so manually, eg, using
   Bourne shell syntax:

   $ python whatever.py &
   $ echo >whatever.pid  "$!"

   All of the daemons use syslog. At present they all set LOG_PERROR, so
   all logging also goes to stderr.

rpkid.py

   rpkid is the main RPKI engine daemon. Configuration of rpkid is a two
   step process: a config file to bootstrap rpkid to the point where it
   can speak using the left-right protocol, followed by dynamic
   configuration via the left-right protocol. In production use the latter
   stage would be handled by the IRBE stub; for test and develoment
   purposes it's handled by the irbe_cli.py command line interface or by
   the testbed.py test framework.

   rpkid stores dynamic data in an SQL database, which must have been
   created for it, as explained in the installation guide.

   The default config file is rpkid.conf, start rpkid with "-c filename"
   to choose a different config file. All options are in the section
   "[rpkid]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER
   or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * startup-message: String to log on startup, useful when debugging a
       collection of rpkid instances at once.

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to rpkid's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for rpkid's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to rpkid's
       database.

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
       certificate verification within rpkid traces back to this trust
       anchor.

     * rpkid-cert: Name of file containing rpkid's own BPKI EE
       certificate.

     * rpkid-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       rpkid-cert.

     * irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by IRBE
       when talking to rpkid.

     * irdb-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by irdbd.

     * irdb-url: Service URL for irdbd. Must be a https:// URL.

     * server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS
       connections. Current default is INADDR_ANY (IPv4 0.0.0.0); this
       will need to be hacked to support IPv6 for production.

     * server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

pubd.py

   pubd is the publication daemon. It implements the server side of the
   publication protocol, and is used by rpkid to publish the certificates
   and other objects that rpkid generates.

   pubd is separate from rpkid for two reasons:

     * The hosting model allows entities which choose to run their own
       copies of rpkid to publish their output under a common publication
       point. In general, encouraging shared publication services where
       practical is a good thing for relying parties, as it will speed up
       rcynic synchronization time.

     * The publication server has to run on (or at least close to) the
       publication point itself, which in turn must be on a publically
       reachable server to be useful. rpkid, on the other hand, need only
       be reachable by the IRBE and its children in the RPKI tree. rpkid
       is a much more complex piece of software than pubd, so in some
       situations it might make sense to wrap tighter firewall constraints
       around rpkid than would be practical if rpkid and pubd were a
       single program.

   pubd stores dynamic data in an SQL database, which must have been
   created for it, as explained in the installation guide. pubd also
   stores the published objects themselves as disk files in a configurable
   location which should correspond to an appropriate module definition in
   rsync.conf.

   The default config file is pubd.conf, start pubd with "-c filename" to
   choose a different config file. ALl options are in the section
   "[pubd]". Certifiates, keys, and trust anchors may be either DER or PEM
   format.

   Config file options:

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to pubd's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for pubd's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to pubd's
       database.

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing master BPKI trust anchor for pubd.
       All BPKI validation in pubd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by IRBE
       when talking to pubd.

     * pubd-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by pubd.

     * pubd-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       pubd-cert.

     * server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS
       connections. Current default is INADDR_ANY (IPv4 0.0.0.0); this
       will need to be hacked to support IPv6 for production.

     * server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

     * publication-base: Path to base of filesystem tree where pubd should
       store publishable objects. Default is "publication/".

rootd.py

   rootd is a stripped down implmenetation of (only) the server side of
   the up-down protocol. It's a separate program because the root
   certificate of an RPKI certificate tree requires special handling and
   may also require a special handling policy. rootd is a simple
   implementation intended for test use, it's not suitable for use in a
   production system. All configuration comes via the config file.

   The default config file is rootd.conf, start rootd with "-c filename"
   to choose a different config file. All options are in the section
   "[rootd]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER
   or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
       certificate validation in rootd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * rootd-bpki-cert: Name of file containing rootd's own BPKI
       certificate.

     * rootd-bpki-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       rootd-bpki-cert.

     * rootd-bpki-crl: Name of file containing BPKI CRL that would cover
       rootd-bpki-cert had it been revoked.

     * child-bpki-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate for
       rootd's one and only child (RPKI engine to which rootd issues an
       RPKI certificate).

     * server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS
       connections. Default is localhost.

     * server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

     * rpki-root-key: Name of file containing RSA key to use in signing
       resource certificates.

     * rpki-root-cert: Name of file containing self-signed root resource
       certificate corresponding to rpki-root-key.

     * rpki-root-dir: Name of directory where rootd should write RPKI
       subject certificate, manifest, and CRL.

     * rpki-subject-cert: Name of file that rootd should use to save the
       one and only certificate it issues. Default is "Subroot.cer".

     * rpki-root-crl: Name of file to which rootd should save its RPKI
       CRL. Default is "Root.crl".

     * rpki-root-manifest: Name of file to which rootd should save its
       RPKI manifest. Default is "Root.mnf".

     * rpki-subject-pkcs10: Name of file that rootd should use when saving
       a copy of the received PKCS #10 request for a resource certificate.
       This is only used for debugging. Default is not to save the PKCS
       #10 request.

irdbd.py

   irdbd is a sample implemntation of the server side of the IRDB callback
   subset of the left-right protocol. In production use this service is a
   function of the IRBE stub; irdbd may be suitable for production use in
   simple cases, but an IR with a complex IRDB may need to extend or
   rewrite irdbd.

   irdbd requires a pre-populated database to represent the IR's
   customers. irdbd expects this database to use the SQL schema defined in
   rpkid/irdbd.sql. Once this database has been populated, the IRBE stub
   needs to create the appropriate objects in rpkid's database via the
   control subset of the left-right protocol, and store the linkage IDs
   (foreign keys into rpkid's database, basicly) in the IRDB. The
   irbe-setup.py program shows an example of how to do this.

   irdbd's default config file is irdbd.conf, start irdbd with "-c
   filename" to choose a different config file. All options are in the
   section "[irdbd]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in
   either DER or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * startup-message: String to log on startup, useful when debugging a
       collection of irdbd instances at once.

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for irdbd's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
       certificate validation in irdbd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * irdbd-cert: Name of file containing irdbd's own BPKI certificate.

     * irdbd-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       irdbd-cert.

     * rpkid-cert: Name of file containing certificate used the one and
       only by rpkid instance authorized to contact this irdbd instance.

     * https-url: Service URL for irdbd. Must be a https:// URL.

irbe_cli.py

   irbe_cli is a simple command line client for the control subsets of the
   left-right and publication protocols. In production use this
   functionality would be part of the IRBE stub.

   Basic configuration of irbe_cli is handled via a config file. The
   specific action or actions to be performed are specified on the command
   line, and map closely to the protocols themselves.

   At present the user is assumed to be able to read the (XML) left-right
   and publication protocol messages, and with one exception, irdbd-cli
   makes no attempt to interpret the responses other than to check for
   signature and syntax errors. The one exception is that, if the
   --pem_out option is specified on the command line, any PKCS #10
   requests received from rpkid will be written in PEM format to that
   file; this makes it easier to hand these requests off to the business
   PKI (BPKI in order to issue signing certs corresponding to newly
   generated business keys.

      Command line IR back-end control program for rpkid and pubd.

   Global options (--config, --help, --pem_out) come first, then zero or
   more commands (parent, repository, self, child, route_origin, bsc,
   config, client), each followed by its own set of options. The commands
   map to elements in the protocols, and the command-specific options map
   to attributes or subelements for those commands.

   --tag is an optional arbitrary tag (think IMAP) to simplify matching up
   replies with batched queries.

   --*_id options refer to the primary keys of previously created objects.

   The remaining options are specific to the particular commands, and
   follow directly from the protocol specifications.

   A trailing "=" in the above option summary indicates that an option
   takes a value, eg, "--action create" or "--action=create". Options
   without a trailing "=" correspond to boolean control attributes.

   The default config file for irbe_cli is irbe_cli.conf, start irbe_cli
   with "-c filename" (or "--config filename") to choose a different
   config file. All options are in the section "[irbe_cli]". Certificates,
   keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * rpkid-bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor to use
       when authenticating messages from rpkid.

     * rpkid-irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate irbe_cli

       pubd-irbe-cert.

     * pubd-cert: Name of file containing pubd's BPKI certificate.

     * pubd-url: Service URL for pubd. Must be a https:// URL.

cross_certify.py

   cross_certify.py is a small tool to extract certain fields from an
   existing X.509 certificate and generate issue a new certificate that
   can be used as part of a cross-certification chain. cross_certify
   doesn't take a config file, all of its arguments are specified on the
   command line.

    python cross_certify.py { -i | --in     } input_cert
                            { -c | --ca     } issuing_cert
                            { -k | --key    } issuing_cert_key

                            [ { -l | --lifetime } timedelta ]

irbe-setup.py config file

   Warning:
          irbe-setup is old code, not currently used, kept in case it is
          useful at some later date. It may not work properly or at all.
          If you don't understand what it does, you don't need it. You
          have been warned.

   The default config file is irbe.conf, start rpkid with "-c filename" to
   choose a different config file. Most options are in the section
   "[irbe_cli]", but a few are in the section "[irdbd]". Certificates,
   keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER or PEM format.

   Options in the "[irbe_cli]" section:

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor.

     * irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate irbe-setup
       should use.

     * irbe-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       irbe-cert.

     * rpkid-cert: Name of file containing rpkid's BPKI certificate.

     * https-url: Service URL for rpkid. Must be a https:// URL.

   Options in the "[irdbd]" section:

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for irdbd's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

cronjob.py

   This is a trivial program to trigger a cron run within rpkid. Once
   rpkid has been converted to the planned event-driven model, this
   function will be handled internally, but for now it has to be triggered
   by an external program. For pseudo-production use one would run this
   program under the system cron daemon. For scripted testing it happens
   to be useful to be able to control when cron cycles occur, so at the
   current stage of code development use of an external trigger is a
   useful feature.

   The default config file is cronjob.conf, start cronjob with "-c
   filename" to choose a different config file. All options are in the
   section "[cronjob]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in
   either DER or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor.

     * irbe-cert: Name of file containing cronjob.py's BPKI certificate.

     * https-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       irbe-cert.

     * rpkid-cert: Name of file containing rpkid's BPKI certificate.

     * https-url: Service URL for rpkid. Must be a https:// URL.

testbed.py:

   testbed is a test harness to set up and run a collection of rpkid and
   irdbd instances under scripted control. testbed is a very recent
   addition to the toolset and is still evolving rapidly.

   Unlike the programs described above, testbed takes two configuration
   files in different languages. The first configuration file uses the
   same syntax as the above configuration files but is completely
   optional. The second configuration file is the test script, which is
   encoded using the YAML serialization language (see http://www.yaml.org/
   for more information on YAML). The YAML script is not optional, as it
   describes the test layout. testbed is designed to support running a
   fairly wide set of test configurations as canned scripts without
   writing any new control code. The intent is to make it possible to
   write meaningful regression tests.

   All of the options in in the first (optional) configuration file are
   just overrides for wired-in default values. In most cases the defaults
   will suffice, and the set of options is still in flux, so only a few of
   the options are described here. The default name for this configuration
   file is testbed.conf, run testbed with "-c filename" to change it.

   testbed.conf options:

     * testbed_dir: Working directory into which testbed should write the
       (many) files it generates. Default is "testbed.dir".

     * irdb_db_pass: MySQL password for the "irdb" user. Default is
       "fnord". You may want to override this.

     * rpki_db_pass: MySQL password for the "rpki" user. Default is
       "fnord". You may want to override this.

     * rootd_sia: rsync URI naming a (perhaps fictious) directory to use
       as the id-ad-caRepository SIA value in the generated root resource
       certificate. Default is "rsync://wombat.invalid/". You may want to
       override this if you intend to run an rsync server and test against
       the generated results using rcynic. This default will likely change
       if and when testbed learns how to run rcynic itself as part of the
       test suite.

   The second configuration file is named testbed.yaml by default, run
   testbed with "-y filename" to change it. The YAML file contains
   multiple YAML "documents". The first document describes the initial
   test layout and resource allocations, subsequent documents describe
   modifications to the initial allocations and other parameters.
   Resources listed in the initial layout are aggregated automatically, so
   that a node in the resource hierarchy automatically receives the
   resources it needs to issue whatever its children are listed as
   holding. Actions in the subsequent documents are modifications to the
   current resource set, modifications to validity dates or other
   non-resource parameters, or special commands like "sleep". The details
   are still evolving, but here's an example of current usage:

     name:           RIR
     valid_for:      2d
     sia_base:       "rsync://wombat.invalid/"
     kids:
       - name: LIR0
      kids:
        - name: Alice
          ipv4: 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.33
          asn:  64533
     ---
     - name: Alice
       valid_add:   10
     ---
     - name: Alice
       add_as: 33
       valid_add:   2d
     ---
     - name: Alice
       valid_sub:   2d
     ---
     - name: Alice
       valid_for:   10d

   This specifies an initial layout consisting of an RPKI engine named
   "RIR", with one child "LIR0", which in turn has one child "Alice".
   Alice has a set of assigned resources, and all resources in the system
   are initially set to be valid for two days from the time at which the
   test is started. The first subsequent document adds ten seconds to the
   validity interval for Alice's resources and makes no other
   modifications. The second subsequent document grants Alice additional
   resources and adds another two days to the validity interval for
   Alice's resources. The next document subtracts two days from the
   validity interval for Alice's resources. The final document sets the
   validity interval for Alice's resources to ten days.

   Operators in subsequent (update) documents:

     * add_as, add_v4, add_v6: These add ASN, IPv4, or IPv6 resources,
       respectively.

     * sub_as, sub_v4, sub_v6: These subtract resources.

     * valid_until: Set an absolute expiration date.

     * valid_for: Set a relative expiration date.

     * valid_add, valid_sub: Add to or subtract from validity interval.

     * sleep [interval]: Sleep for specified interval, or until testbed
       receives a SIGALRM signal.

   Absolute timestamps should be in the form shown (UTC timestamp format
   as used in XML).

   Intervals (valid_add, valid_sub, valid_for, sleep) are either integers,
   in which case they're interpreted as seconds, or are a string of the
   form "wD xH yM zS" where w, x, y, and z are integers and D, H, M, and S
   indicate days, hours, minutes, and seconds. In the latter case all of
   the fields are optional, but at least one must be specified. For
   example, "3D4H" means "three days plus four hours".

testpoke.py

   This is a command-line client for the up-down protocol. Unlike all of
   the above programs, testpoke does not accept a config file in
   OpenSSL-compatable format at all. Instead, it is configured exclusively
   by a YAML script. testpoke's design was constrained by a desire to have
   it be compatable with APNIC's rpki_poke.pl tool, so that the two tools
   could use a common configuration language to simplify scripted testing.
   There are minor variations due to slightly different feature sets, but
   YAML files intended for one program will usually work with the other.

   README for APNIC's tool describing the input language can be found at
   http://mirin.apnic.net/svn/rpki_engine/branches/gary-poker/client/poke/
   README.

   testpoke.py takes a simplified command line and uses only one YAML
   input file.

 Usage: python testpoke.py [ { -y | --yaml }    configfile ]
                           [ { -r | --request } requestname ]
                           [ { -h | --help } ]

   Default configuration file is testpoke.yaml, override with --yaml
   option.

   The --request option specifies the specific command within the YAML
   file to execute.

   Sample configuration file:

     ---
     # Sample YAML configuration file for testpoke.py

     version: 1
     posturl: https://localhost:4433/up-down/1
     recipient-id: wombat
     sender-id: "1"

     cms-cert-file: biz-certs/Frank-EE.cer
     cms-key-file: biz-certs/Frank-EE.key
     cms-ca-cert-file: biz-certs/Bob-Root.cer
     cms-cert-chain-file: [ biz-certs/Frank-CA.cer ]

     ssl-cert-file: biz-certs/Frank-EE.cer
     ssl-key-file: biz-certs/Frank-EE.key
     ssl-ca-cert-file: biz-certs/Bob-Root.cer

     requests:
       list:
      type: list
       issue:
      type: issue
      class: 1
      sia: [ "rsync://bandicoot.invalid/some/where/" ]
       revoke:
      type: revoke
      class: 1
      ski: "CB5K6APY-4KcGAW9jaK_cVPXKX0"

   testpoke adds one extension to the language described in APNIC's
   README: the cms-cert-chain-* and ssl-cert-chain-* options, which allow
   one to specify a chain of intermediate certificates to be presented in
   the CMS or TLS protocol. APNIC's initial implementation required direct
   knowledge of the issuing certificate (ie, it supported a maximum chain
   length of one); subsequent APNIC code changes have probably relaxed
   this restriction, and with luck APNIC has copied testpoke's syntax to
   express chains of intermediate certificates.

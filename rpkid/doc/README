Internals documentation for the RPKI CA tools.

Once upon a time this included the hand-written documentation for the
CA tools, but that is now part of the overall package documentation.
What's left here is just what Doxygen generates from the source code
and a few Graphviz diagrams.

At the moment the control for the stuff generated here is still
../Makefile, that may change at some point.

We no longer generate the documentation here automatically, as it's
kind of large and we're not sure anybody else cares about it, so if
you want this manual you'll have to install Doxygen and build it
yourself.

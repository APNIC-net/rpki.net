Documentation for rpkid and friends.

Most of the files in this directory are automatically generated from
the source code.  Most of the hand-written documentation for rpkid and
friends is written using Doxygen markup so that it will all appear in
the manual.

The primary tool for generating documentation is Doxygen, which
produces the HTML and PDF versions of the manual.  Certain pages are
also dumped from HTML to flat text.

See rpkid/Makefile for details on how all this happens.

Documentation for rpkid and friends.

Other than this file, everything in this directory is automatically
generated from the source code.  Most of the hand-written
documentation for rpkid and friends is written using Doxygen markup so
that it will all appear in the manual.

The primary tool for generating documentation is Doxygen, which
produces the HTML and PDF versions of the manual.  Certain pages are
also dumped from HTML to flat text.

See rpkid/Makefile for details on how all this happens.

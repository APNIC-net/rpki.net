irdbd

   irdbd is a sample implemntation of the server side of the IRDB callback
   subset of the left-right protocol.

   In production use this service is a function of the IRBE stub; irdbd
   may be suitable for production use in simple cases, but an IR with a
   complex IRDB may need to extend or rewrite irdbd.

   irdbd requires a pre-populated database to represent the IR's
   customers. irdbd expects this database to use the SQL schema defined in
   rpkid/irdbd.sql. Once this database has been populated, the IRBE stub
   needs to create the appropriate objects in rpkid's database via the
   control subset of the left-right protocol, and store the linkage IDs
   (foreign keys into rpkid's database, basicly) in the IRDB.

   irdbd's default config file is irdbd.conf, start irdbd with "-c
   filename" to choose a different config file. All options are in the
   section "[irdbd]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in
   either DER or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * startup-message: String to log on startup, useful when debugging a
       collection of irdbd instances at once.

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for irdbd's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to irdbd's
       database.

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
       certificate validation in irdbd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * irdbd-cert: Name of file containing irdbd's own BPKI certificate.

     * irdbd-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       irdbd-cert.

     * rpkid-cert: Name of file containing certificate used the one and
       only by rpkid instance authorized to contact this irdbd instance.

     * https-url: Service URL for irdbd. Must be a https:// URL.

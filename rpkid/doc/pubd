pubd

   pubd is the publication daemon.

   It implements the server side of the publication protocol, and is used
   by rpkid to publish the certificates and other objects that rpkid
   generates.

   pubd is separate from rpkid for two reasons:

     * The hosting model allows entities which choose to run their own
       copies of rpkid to publish their output under a common publication
       point. In general, encouraging shared publication services where
       practical is a good thing for relying parties, as it will speed up
       rcynic synchronization time.

     * The publication server has to run on (or at least close to) the
       publication point itself, which in turn must be on a publically
       reachable server to be useful. rpkid, on the other hand, need only
       be reachable by the IRBE and its children in the RPKI tree. rpkid
       is a much more complex piece of software than pubd, so in some
       situations it might make sense to wrap tighter firewall constraints
       around rpkid than would be practical if rpkid and pubd were a
       single program.

   pubd stores dynamic data in an SQL database, which must have been
   created for it, as explained in the installation guide. pubd also
   stores the published objects themselves as disk files in a configurable
   location which should correspond to an appropriate module definition in
   rsync.conf.

   The default config file is pubd.conf, start pubd with "-c filename" to
   choose a different config file. ALl options are in the section
   "[pubd]". Certifiates, keys, and trust anchors may be either DER or PEM
   format.

   Config file options:

     * sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to pubd's
       database.

     * sql-database: MySQL's database name for pubd's database.

     * sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to pubd's
       database.

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing master BPKI trust anchor for pubd.
       All BPKI validation in pubd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by IRBE
       when talking to pubd.

     * pubd-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by pubd.

     * pubd-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       pubd-cert.

     * server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS
       connections. Current default is INADDR_ANY (IPv4 0.0.0.0); this
       will need to be hacked to support IPv6 for production.

     * server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

     * publication-base: Path to base of filesystem tree where pubd should
       store publishable objects. Default is "publication/".

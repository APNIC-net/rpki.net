rootd

   rootd is a stripped down implmenetation of (only) the server side of
   the up-down protocol.

   It's a separate program because the root certificate of an RPKI
   certificate tree requires special handling and may also require a
   special handling policy. rootd is a simple implementation intended for
   test use, it's not suitable for use in a production system. All
   configuration comes via the config file.

   The default config file is rootd.conf, start rootd with "-c filename"
   to choose a different config file. All options are in the section
   "[rootd]". Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER
   or PEM format.

   Config file options:

     * bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI
       certificate validation in rootd traces back to this trust anchor.

     * rootd-bpki-cert: Name of file containing rootd's own BPKI
       certificate.

     * rootd-bpki-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to
       rootd-bpki-cert.

     * rootd-bpki-crl: Name of file containing BPKI CRL that would cover
       rootd-bpki-cert had it been revoked.

     * child-bpki-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate for
       rootd's one and only child (RPKI engine to which rootd issues an
       RPKI certificate).

     * server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS
       connections. Default is localhost.

     * server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

     * rpki-root-key: Name of file containing RSA key to use in signing
       resource certificates.

     * rpki-root-cert: Name of file containing self-signed root resource
       certificate corresponding to rpki-root-key.

     * rpki-root-dir: Name of directory where rootd should write RPKI
       subject certificate, manifest, and CRL.

     * rpki-subject-cert: Name of file that rootd should use to save the
       one and only certificate it issues. Default is "Subroot.cer".

     * rpki-root-crl: Name of file to which rootd should save its RPKI
       CRL. Default is "Root.crl".

     * rpki-root-manifest: Name of file to which rootd should save its
       RPKI manifest. Default is "Root.mnf".

     * rpki-subject-pkcs10: Name of file that rootd should use when saving
       a copy of the received PKCS #10 request for a resource certificate.
       This is only used for debugging. Default is not to save the PKCS
       #10 request.

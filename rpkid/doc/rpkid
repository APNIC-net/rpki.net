****** rpkid ******

rpkid is the main RPKI engine daemon.

Configuration of rpkid is a two step process: a config file to bootstrap rpkid
to the point where it can speak using the left-right_protocol, followed by
dynamic configuration via the left-right protocol. In production use the latter
stage would be handled by the IRBE stub; for test and develoment purposes it's
handled by the irbe_cli command line interface or by the smoketest test
framework.

rpkid stores dynamic data in an SQL database, which must have been created for
it, as explained in the installation_guide.

The default config file is rpkid.conf, start rpkid with "-c filename" to choose
a different config file. All options are in the section "[rpkid]".
Certificates, keys, and trust anchors may be in either DER or PEM format.

Config file options:

* startup-message: String to log on startup, useful when debugging a collection
  of rpkid instances at once.

* sql-username: Username to hand to MySQL when connecting to rpkid's database.

* sql-database: MySQL's database name for rpkid's database.

* sql-password: Password to hand to MySQL when connecting to rpkid's database.

* bpki-ta: Name of file containing BPKI trust anchor. All BPKI certificate
  verification within rpkid traces back to this trust anchor.

* rpkid-cert: Name of file containing rpkid's own BPKI EE certificate.

* rpkid-key: Name of file containing RSA key corresponding to rpkid-cert.

* irbe-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by IRBE when talking
  to rpkid.

* irdb-cert: Name of file containing BPKI certificate used by irdbd.

* irdb-url: Service URL for irdbd. Must be a https:// URL.

* server-host: Hostname or IP address on which to listen for HTTPS connections.
  Current default is INADDR_ANY (IPv4 0.0.0.0); this will need to be hacked to
  support IPv6 for production.

* server-port: TCP port on which to listen for HTTPS connections.

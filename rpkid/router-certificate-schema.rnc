# RelaxNG Schema for BGPSEC router certificate interchange format.
#
# At least for now, this is a trivial encapsulation of a PKCS #10
# request, a set (usually containing exactly one member) of autonomous
# system numbers, and a router-id.  Be warned that this could change
# radically by the time we have any real operational understanding of
# how these things will be used, this is just our current best guess
# to let us move forward on initial coding.
# 
# libxml2 (including xmllint) only groks the XML syntax of RelaxNG, so
# run the compact syntax through trang to get XML syntax.

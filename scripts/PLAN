Rough plan for initial prototype RE.

1) Hack quick cert generator [done]

2) Hack xml-parse-test into something that can:

 - Generate XML (just compose directly, probably)
 - Encode XML in CMS using specified signing key and certs
 - Write that to a destination file

 - Pick up signed CMS from from a file
 - Check CMS signatures and extract XML
 - Validate (xmllint --relaxng) the XML
 - Decode (xml.sax) the XML and dump the result

 Log everything as we go.
 data structures.

Schema is RNC (RelaxNG Compact) syntax, xmllint wants RNG (RelaxNG
XML) syntax, so use /usr/ports/textproc/trang to convert:

    $ trang foo.rnc foo.rng

3) Whack (2) into something that does this over minimal HTTP.

4) [to be continued...]

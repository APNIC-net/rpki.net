Haven't done anything about db.commit() and db.rollback() yet, for
that matter haven't yet whacked MySQL to enable those features.

Access to object data attributes really ought to be through accessor
methods so that the .set() method can set the sql_dirty flag
automagically.  Not done yet.

Hmm, I seem to have goofed on the bsc table, need a column for the
hash algorithm after all, as it's not intrinsic to the key.  Probably
ought to let it be set independently of the key too.  But for the
moment I'm only supporting 2048-bit RSA with SHA-256 digests, so
fixing this is not urgent.



To do list:

- publication protocol and implementation

- manifest generation

- publication hooks into everything - need not wait for protocol, can just log what would happen for now

  - cert publication

  - crl publication

  - manifest publication

  - withdrawal of all of the above

- child batch processing loop, eg, regeneration or removal of expired certs, crl and manifest update, etc

  hmm, should this be an iteration over child_cert objects or over ca
  objects?  probably the latter as the ca is the actor in pretty much
  everything that might need to be done

- tiny up-down root server -- no sql or left-right needed, just config
  file, http server, static root cert and key.  in theory this should
  just be a matter of subtyping the main up-down code while overriding
  the serve_pdu() methods.

"""
Hosted GUI client startup script, for workshops, etc.

This isn't usable yet.

As of when this is run, we assume that the tarball (contents TBD and
perhaps changing from one workshop to another) have been unpacked,
that we are on some Unix-like machine, and that we are executing in
a Python interpreter.  We have to check anything else we care about.

A collection of small RPKI utility programs which can be combined in
various useful ways by relying parties or by rpkid test scripts.

uri/uri:
	Extract URIs from AIA, SIA, and CRLDP extensions of an X.509v3
	certificate.

	Usage: uri [-p | -d] cert [cert...]

uri/*.awk:
	Experimental AWK scripts to postprocess uri/uri's output in
	various ways.

hashdir/hashdir:
	Copy authenticated result tree from an rcynic run into the
	format expected by most OpenSSL-based programs ("PEM" format
	files with names in the form that OpenSSL's -CApath lookup
	routines expect).
			
	Usage: hashdir input-directory output-directory

print_manifest/print_manifest:
	Prettyprint the content of a manifest.  Does NOT attempt to
	verify the signature.
			
	Usage: print_manifest manifest [manifest...]

print_roa/print_roa:
	Prettyprint the content of a ROA.  Does NOT attempt to verify
	the signature.

	Usage: print_roa ROA [ROA...]

find_roa/find_roa:
	Search authenticated result tree from an rcynic run for ROAs
	matching specified prefixes.

	Usage: find_roa authtree prefix [prefix...]

find_roa/test_roa.sh:
	Script combining hashdir/hashdir, print_roa/print_roa,
	find_roa/find_roa, and the OpenSSL CLI tool.  Builds hashed
 	directory, searches for ROAs matching specified prefixes,
	verifies the CMS signature and certificate path of each ROA
	found, and prettyprints each ROA that passes the checks.

	Usage: test_roa.sh authtree prefix [prefix...]
